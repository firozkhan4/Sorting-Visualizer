# Sorting Visualizer Project

This is a web-based **Sorting Visualizer** that allows users to visually explore various sorting algorithms in action. The tool is interactive, customizable, and includes a variety of popular sorting techniques. Users can generate random arrays, select their preferred algorithm, and see how the sorting process works step-by-step.

## Features

1. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Simple and intuitive design for users of all levels.
   - A dynamic array visualizer that displays the array as a series of vertical bars.

2. **Array Customization:**
   - Generate new random arrays with the **"New Array"** button.
   - Adjust the size of the array using the slider input.

3. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Choose from a wide variety of sorting algorithms:
     - Bubble Sort
     - Selection Sort
     - Insertion Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Quick Sort
     - Heap Sort
     - Shell Sort
     - Tim Sort
     - Tree Sort
     - Smooth Sort
     - Counting Sort
     - Radix Sort
     - Bucket Sort
     - Pigeonhole Sort
     - Intro Sort
     - Cocktail Shaker Sort
     - Gnome Sort
     - Odd-Even Sort
     - Bitonic Sort
     - Bogo Sort
     - Comb Sort

4. **Sorting Visualization:**
   - View the sorting process in real-time as the bars rearrange themselves.

   - The main structure of the web page, which includes:
     - A navigation bar with the project name.
     - A sidebar for user controls (array generation, sorting, and algorithm selection).
     - A container for displaying the sorting visualization.
     - Footer with author attribution.

### 2. **CSS File (`styles.css`):**
   - Contains all styling rules for the project:
     - Layouts for the main content, sidebar, and footer.
     - Styling for buttons, dropdowns, sliders, and array bars.

### 3. **JavaScript File (`app.js`):**
   - The core logic of the project:
     - Handles the generation of random arrays.
     - Implements sorting algorithms.
     - Animates the sorting process in the visualizer.
